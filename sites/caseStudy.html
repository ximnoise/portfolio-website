          <h2>Overview</h2>
          <p>
            Comgear is a mobile application, developed using React Native,
            that provides users with a chat interface and options to share images and they location.
            Users are able to authenticate anonymously and the chat conversation
            are stored locally and in the Google Firebase Database.
          </p>
          <br />
          <h2>Purpose & Context</h2>
          <p>
            Comgear was a personal project I built as part of my
            Full-Stack-Web development course at CareerFoundry.
            It should show my mastery of building Full-Stack mobile applications.
          </p>
          <br />
          <h2>Objective</h2>
          <p>
            The aim of this project was to have an ambitious full-stack mobile project
            I can add to my professional portfolio. The problem I wanted to solve is to
            build the server-side on Googles Firebase architecture and the
            client-side with a React framework for mobile.

          <h2>Approach</h2>
          <br />
          <h3>Server-Side</h3>
          <p>
            I created the Sever-Side of this project based on Google Firebase Database
            where every chat message, image and location is stored.
            Every message is stored in a JSON Format.
            Through Google Firebase the users can also authenticate anonymously.

            <img src="../img/comgear_database_img.png" class="section__img__server" alt="Comgear Image Database" />
          </div>
          <br />
          <h3>Client-Side</h3>
          <p>
            The Client-Side of this project I build with React-Native and on top the Gifted Chat library.
            With Gifted Chat I had a basic chat interface but I customize every detail of the interface on my own.
            The user can easily share images and locations over a
            button near the input field, when he grants access to image library or location.

          <h2>Challenges</h2>
          <p>
            This was one of my favorite projects in the CareerFoundry bootcamp.
            I have enjoyed building a mobile application with Google Firebase architecture
            and the cross-platform mobile framework React Native. Developing the client-side,
            it took me a bit of effort to understand how React Native and Gifted Chat works
            and how to achieve the desired results. But with help of my great tutor and self study,
            I achieve my goals.
          </p>
          <br />
          <h2>Duration</h2>
          <p>
            The development of this project took me a bit longer as it normally took to complete a
            CareerFoundry achievement. It was because I needed time to wrap my head into
            mobile development with this new technologies.
